# General Approach is to Start Slow

Commit often

## Planning Phase

### 0. Choose Your Project

Choose what sparks joy in you but is simple:

- What API can I call for this, any public APIs I can use to make things easy? (useEffect)
- What project would need at least 4-5 different pages
- What's a site that would require having a form
- Something that would help me to use useParams and grab parameters off the route

### 1. Create Mockup

High or low fidelity:

- **Figma** for high fidelity
- **Excalidraw or paper** for low fidelity

### 2. Slicing Step

Thinking in React

**Break Things Down into the Tiniest Actionable Pieces**

**Project Organization:**

- Plan out each feature or component using something like [Trello](https://trello.com), or any other organization app that you have

**Component Planning Template:**

- Show the mock up of the component
- What are the inputs (props)
- What if any effects does it use

**Definition of Done for Each Component:**

- Component renders without errors
- Props are properly typed/documented
- Component is responsive (if applicable)
- Basic functionality works as expected
- Component is committed to version control

### 3. Choose Technologies

CSS options:

- **Tailwind**
- **React Bootstrap** - https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/docs/getting-started/introduction

## Implementation Phase

### Development Steps

1. **Start up application** with Vite template

2. **Add in React Router**

3. **Add simple components** - Create a simple component or two, add a route and test visiting them

4. **Build out skeleton** - Start with each component, or start with pages, and slowly add components

5. **Commit frequently** - Commit each time you add a component, after it has been tested

6. **Fill out components** - Add functionality and content to your components

7. **Touch ups** - Polish and refine as needed
