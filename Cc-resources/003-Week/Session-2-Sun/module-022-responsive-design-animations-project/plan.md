## We need to plan out the project!

### What do we need?

1. Pick the Option - Hobby or Portfolio
2. Grab some inspiration from other pages
   1. Open Dev Tools
   2. Go to Device Mode
   3. Change to Iphone SE
   4. Cmd+Shift+P (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+P for windows to capture the screenshot
   5. Do the same for the tablet and desktop views
3. Mock up of our site
   - excalidraw.com
   - figma.com
   - low or high fidelity mockups
     - low fidelity
     - (excalidraw)
     - focus on big picture
     - fast
     - less decisions
     - hight fidelity (figma)
     - lets you get graular with how your site looks
     - slower
     - more decisions
4. Paste the mobile version into your mocking tool from each site inspiration example
5. Create your layout
   - Start with the general layout
   - Create your components
   - This doesn't need to be perfect
   - 30min-2hr on the mock up
   - Label the element names for parts of your site
   - create the mobile layout first, be happy with it, then move on to tablet and desktop
6. Now with the mockup you can decide the UI Framework
   - Boostrap
   - Tailwind
7. Add and test to your index.html/stylesheet.css:
   - Tailwind/Bootstrap
   - Font Awesome
   - Google Fonts
8. Skeleton of your site
   - Mobile version first
   - Loading the site with Device Mode in Chrome Dev Tools (IPhone SE)
   - Start with header, main, footer
   - Start to fill in the rest
9. Suggest doing mobile > tablet > Desktop for each main section of your site
   - i.e. header is made first on mobile > then header works on tablet > then header works on desktop
   - dont forget about potentially testing in https://responsively.app/
     for faster feedback
10. Plan to have done by the start of next week (Sat)
