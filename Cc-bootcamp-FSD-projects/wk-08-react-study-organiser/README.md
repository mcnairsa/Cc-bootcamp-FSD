## Purpose
- Organisation of itme
- Goal settting ... accountability
- **Overall**: to facillitate the meeting of externally set objectives through personal management of the process
- **Esoterically**: to act as a mirror and thereby facillitate growth [^of awareness-of-self as learner and collaborator]
- **A Place to** ... plan, to reflect and to replan.

## Core Concepts
- **Course/Camp** i.e. the story arc of the bootcamp or whatever E.g: *Codecademy FSD Bootcamp*.
- **Week** a basic unit of the crs/camp. Starts wwith the calendar day of the first session of a section or major unit. E.g: *React Fundamentals* 
- **Day** (48hr or is that an unnecessary complicaton?).
- **Block** a chunk of time in *decimal hours* i.e. an hour but the smallest sub-unit of an hour is six minutes.
- **Semester** May be useful for longer undertakings but here it's not necessary. Can be added later. At present it is synonymous with course/camp.

## Mobile First?##
Is it even feasible for this project?

## API
Is there a way to access your Codecademy Dashboard via an API?

## Top-down or Bottom-up?
Both!
E.g: spinner for 24/48hr timer is bottum-up. It's a component like a button that we can create in its own right and totally bottom-up. The vision for the whole thing can evolve in a top-down fashion from *Course* to *week* to *Day*.

## History
It may further the purposes to be able to access history of planning so that the user can compare expected time against actual time taken.
