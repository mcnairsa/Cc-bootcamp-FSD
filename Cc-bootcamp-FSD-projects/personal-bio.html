HTML5 document structure (DOCTYPE, html, head, body) Header with name and
navigation menu Meta description and title optimization Professional bio photo
with descriptive alt text Main content with 3 sections (about, skills, contact)
About section with personal bio paragraphs Skills section with organized lists
and categories Contact section with working contact form Contact form with name,
email, and message fields External links to social media or portfolio (can be
placeholder URLs) Working navigation links to page sections Proper heading
hierarchy (h1, h2, h3) Proper form structure with labels and inputs Footer with
copyright information Could Have (Bonus Points): Semantic HTML5 elements
throughout (header, main, section, footer) Additional form fields (subject
dropdown, etc.) Enhanced accessibility features Multiple contact methods (email,
LinkedIn, GitHub) Projects or experience section Creative but professional
content
